1. data_base.edit.add_item() now creates a designated spot for a database in lists if one is not existant.
2. Added new setting to automatically optimize system on startup.
3. A flaw has been seen learking in the dark realms of the code. A fix is coming soon. More info later.
4. Fixed a problem that caused the app to crash when using add_row_term. This is used for the terminal.
5. Added data_base.edit.search_rows(). Used for my custom application.
6. Added data_base.edit.check_owner(). Used to see what permission is required to use the permission. Database allows anyone though to access the database.
7. Fixed a minor problem with data_base.edit.add_row() when giving it a list instead of a string. The function now allows lists.
