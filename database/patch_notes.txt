1. Fixed a problem where if system states that's a database cannot be made, it will still create it, later causing errors.
2. Fixed a problem where remove_column would not give notice if database selected does not exist.
3. Fixed a problem where add_column would add a column to a database that does not exist, later causing errors.
4. Fixed a problem where create database would not create a database even though it meets requirements.
5. Added a class called history to create a record of all that has been done. This will be automated soon.
6. Encrypt and decrypt now encrypts and decrypts history.txt.
7. Database functions now automatically sets database names to .lower()
