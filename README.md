# Database
Discord Server: Null{Private}
<br>A custom database handler. Still in development.

To setup application in windows: Manage application/Windows/setup.bat
<br>To setup application in linux: Manage application/setup.txt

<br>Please note: Latest versions may not support linux.
To help combat this problem. I'm using linux as my OS to run this app. As right now, Code works fine.
<br><br>Nerdy Stuff:<br>For the absolute latest version download the source code. Not in releases. May cause issues. It won't always be tested before updated. Do not do this if you are looking for a stable version.

<br>Latest Notes:<br>1. Linux can use the app no problem.
<br>2. Updates are slowing down as right now more effort is used on the application using this code.
