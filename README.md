<br>A custom database handler. Still in development.

To setup application in windows: Manage application/Windows/setup.bat
<br>To setup application in linux: Manage application/Linux/setup.sh
<br><br>Coming Features for version 0.3.0: <br> 1. A save file check and repair option. <br> 2. Possibly an implementation of a cache file to use significantly less ram after prolonged use.<br> 3. A basic GUI to interact with the handler.<br> 4. A mostly completed text shell to interact with the handler.
<br><br>Please note: Latest versions may not support linux. This will be a temporary so continue to use 0.1.6 if you are using linux. A fix for this will be coming soon. Thank you for your understanding!
